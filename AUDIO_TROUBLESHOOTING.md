# Audio Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: "Audio still loading. Please wait..."

The Gregorian chant audio files are uploaded correctly but experiencing playback issues.

## Diagnosis Steps

### 1. Test Basic HTML5 Audio
Visit: `http://localhost:5000/test-audio.html`

If this works: ✅ Files are fine, React player needs fixing
If this fails: ❌ Server or file format issue

### 2. File Verification
```bash
# Check file sizes (should be 1-10MB each)
ls -lh client/public/audio/

# Check file permissions (should be readable)
ls -la client/public/audio/

# Test HTTP response
curl -I http://localhost:5000/audio/adoro-te-devote.mp3
```

### 3. Browser Console
Check for:
- Network errors (404, 403, CORS)
- Audio format errors
- JavaScript errors

## Known Working Solutions

### Option A: Simplified Audio Player
Replace complex audio player with basic HTML5 audio element wrapped in React.

### Option B: Direct Audio Element
Use `useRef` to directly control an HTML audio element without complex state management.

### Option C: Audio Context API
Use Web Audio API for more control over audio loading and playback.

## Current Status

- ✅ Files uploaded (13 authentic Gregorian chants)
- ✅ Server serving files (200 OK responses)
- ✅ CORS headers configured
- ✅ Proper MIME types (audio/mpeg)
- ❌ React audio player implementation

## Next Steps

1. Test basic HTML5 audio functionality
2. Implement simplified audio player if needed
3. Add user-friendly error messages
4. Ensure browser audio autoplay policies are handled
